# Working with vÃ­tor norton

_Creation Date: July 2020_

## A collection of stuff that might come in handy when working with me

### Things to know about me

- __My name is VÃ­tor Norton__. A lot of people doesn't know my first name, and thats ok. Just call me Norton ðŸ™‚
- I'm a professional software developer since I can remember
- You can find out anything from me on my [website](https://vtnorton.com)
- I speak Portuguese, English, a tiny bit of Spanish and try to speak in Italian and French
- I've published one app to the Windows Store and I'm pretty proud of it.
- Magic, music, TV shows and pastisserie is my hobbies, among other stuff.
- I love GIFs and random stuff
- I'm very relaxed, I rarely get mad about anything or anyone
- This will seem like a rule list, but __I'm very flexible__ and __a very open person__ to talk about anything. I'm __always open to feedbacks__ about good stuff I do or something I need to improve, just come and talk! I won't be mad at you, I promise :D.
- If you disliked one of my atitudes or words, please __come talk to me, I want to be better!__

### Things to know about work

- I live in __SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil__. In the __GMT -3__ time zone.
- I __generally work from ~10:30am to 7pm BRT__, sometimes also in the evening hours if there are too many stuff to do.
  - I avoid taking meetings before noon because that's the time I take to get up to speed on what happened during the night (and also because I'm not a morning person... And I'm usually not portraying happiness before 10am ðŸ˜‚)
  - I also try __not__ to take meetings after 8pm because that's the time when I rest and recover my energies to the next days, but, if it's important, just ping me
  - I value my time off with friends and family, so I avoid to take any work appointments in holidays or weekends, but if it's __necessary__ I'm flexible to make things work.
  - Don't feel obliged to give in to my schedule. Let's try asynchronous syncing, if we can't find face time.
    - I'm completely fond of the idea of using IM to communicate asynchronously all the way
    - I'll try my best to make meetings and other appointments work for both of us time-wise
    - I don't expect you to answer any emails right away, if I sent you an email, that's because the matter it not that important to require immediate response. I'm working when it fits my schedule. Feel free to answer when it fits your schedule. I know that you also have your schedule and tasks, and when you have some time you'll answer me!
    - If you receive an email or an IM from me at unusual times, then the right interpretation is "because Norton is doing work on his schedule" rather than "Norton wants an answer right now."

- I take my communications __very__ seriously
  - I'm usually online on Telegram, WhatsApp and Teams, even if I'm not, will for sure read our messagem within an hour.
  - Sometimes, I'll turn off all communications because I really need to focus, refer to the next topics if you really need my attention
  - I check my emails every couple of hours, so if it's important, message me
  - My mobile is usually muted, i.e. fully silenced to not distract me from the thing I'm currently doing. Calling me without an appointed time usually doesn't work.
  - __If you REALLY need my undivided urgent attention on something hugely important, please try this methods, in this order:__
    - If you work with me, send me a message on Teams.
    - If not
		1. Send me an [e-mail](mailto:vitor@vtnorton.com).
        2. Send me a DM on twitter ([@vt_norton](https://twitter.com/_staticvoid))
        3. Send me a message on [Telegram](https://t.me/vt_norton)
        4. Send me a message on my WhatsApp (if you have my number)
        5. Call me on my phone (don't bother leaving a message on the mailbox, because I don't have one)
  - Please, don't start a conversation asking how I'm doing and wait for my response before asking the real question, I follow the [no hello](https://github.com/sbmueller/nohello/blob/master/index.md#please-dont-say-just-hello-in-chat) policy, so if you want to ask something, just go for it! I'll sure do the same thing to you.
- I'm __very__ organized, and I take personal organization very seriously
  - I rarely accept a meeting without an agenda unless it's a 1:1. I recommend always having an agenda for meetings and if possible, pre-reads. This helps not only with attendance, but also makes the meeting time more productive.
  - I plan my week on Sundays, and I do it very carefully to not add too many tasks in one day because I don't want to have another burnout crisis.
  - Because of the previous topic I generally avoid scheduling things on the same week they'll occur
  - I don't answer work messages after my work hours and on weekends (unless they're super duper important), and I don't expect you to do so too.
  - I set up meetings expecting to finish them in that estimated amount of time. Also, this is in respect of up-following meetings.
  - I try very hard to be __on time for all meetings__, expect me to join 10 to 15 minutes earlier to prepare stuff, that's a personal choice, you don't need to show up earlier if you don't want to.
      - If, for some reason, I'm not able to show up, I'll warn you at least 1 hour before the meeting â€“ I expect you to do the same for me.
  - In meetings, I'll wait for you up to 15 minutes after the scheduled time, if you don't show up and you __didn't warn me__ that you were going to be late, I'll drop off the call and we'll have to reschedule to the next common time
  - One of the things I value most is __responsibility__, so if you have set up a meeting with me and you don't show up, I'll reach out to you and ask what happened, I won't be mad if you have a good reason.
    - __good reason__: Health issues for you or any other person you had to help
    - __good reason__: Family or personal issues
    - __poor reason__: Forgot about it
    - __poor reason__: My computer wasn't working
    - __poor reason__: Ran out of battery
  - Things happen, I know, but __warn me__ about them and I'll be fine
- __I'm an advocate for inclusive behavior and Diversity & Inclusion in general__. I might get back to you to talk with you on a behavior I saw that you showed or you were exposed to. Don't be afraid of talking about that, I'm striving to make things better, not embarrass anyone.
- Amongst other things I value __honesty, respect, objectivity, openness and responsibility__. Call me out if I miss the mark on these!
- If I said I'd do it, I'll do it, no need to message me about the topic every single day.
- I love to chat about random stuff, sometimes I'll take a good while (some days) to answer, if it's not very important, please try __not to bump the conversation expecting me to answer faster__... It won't work. I'll __always__ answer you, no matter what, it can take an hour or two days, but I'll answer you.
  - However, if you see that I took more than four days to answer, something has probably happened and you should ping me, please (I might have read your message and started another task and forgot to answer!)
- As I said, I value objectivity, so please don't ramble around to tell me something, just do it! No matter how bad it is.
