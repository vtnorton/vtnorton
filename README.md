My name is Lucas Santos (he/him). I'm a [Cloud Developer Advocate](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/advocates/lucas-santos) at @microsoft from Brazil! I'm working mostly with containers and Kubernetes along with Node.js and TypeScript! I love Open-Source and I'm a developer since 2011! I love to teach and learn!
